## 🧠 Overview

This repository accompanies a research paper that uses interpretable machine learning to identify key predictors of **self-reported health (SRH)** among American adults, using data from the **2023 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS)**.

The work emphasizes the importance of **behavioral and socio-economic** factors in shaping perceived health and contributes to the intersection of **data science**, **public health**, and **behavioral analytics**.

## 📄 Abstract (Summary)

This study applies machine learning to identify the key predictors of self-reported health (SRH) among U.S. adults using the 2023 BRFSS dataset. Five models were evaluated: **Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, Decision Tree**, and a **Stacked ensemble**. 

To address class imbalance, **Edited Nearest Neighbors (ENN)**, **SMOTE**, and **Repeated Undersampling** were tested, with the latter showing the best performance. Logistic Regression achieved an AUC of **0.81**, and the Stacked model slightly improved it to **0.82**.

**SHAP and feature importance analysis** revealed that income, employment status, physical activity, and mental health status were stronger predictors than traditional risk factors like smoking or heavy drinking. The results are interpreted using the **Social Determinants of Health (SDOH)** and **Health Belief Model (HBM)** frameworks.

> 🎯 **Key Insight**: Behavioral and socio-economic variables outweigh clinical and lifestyle risks in shaping health perception.
